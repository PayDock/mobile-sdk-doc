## Overview

The MobileSDK's pre-built UI widgets seamlessly integrate with Paydock functionality from your native iOS or Android app.

Once you have setup and initialized the MobileSDK in your application, you can use the MobileSDK widgets to access payment flows. These include interacting with GooglePay, ApplePay and Paypal. You can also complete 3DS challenges, capture addresses, securely collect gift card details, and tokenise card details.

## Next steps

# Next steps

1. Begin by [adding the SDK](/setup/installation.md) as a dependency to your app for either iOS or Android.

2. Once the SDK is added, you can [initialize the SDK](/setup/initialise.md) by passing the configuration objects such as your `public_key` and `environment` variable. 

3. After the SDK is initialized, you can optionally customise the appearance of your UI elements using the [theming parameters](/setup/theming.md).

4. Use our widget guides to setup [GooglePay](/widgets/googlepay.md), [ApplePay](/widgets/applepay.md), and [PayPal](/widgets/paypal) - or access features such as [Card Tokenisation](/widgets/card.md), [Address capture](/widgets/address.md), [3DS](/widgets/threeds.md), and [Gift Cards](/widgets/threeds.md).
