> Use a prebuilt form to capture an address. 

## Overview

Paydock's Address Widget enables your customer to prefill a form with either an address or a partial address if available. They can then use the autocomplete field to look up their address by searching for key parts such as their postcode, zip code and so on.

## iOS

### How to initialise the Address widget sheet in iOS

### 1. Overview

The Address Capture Widget collects your customer's billing location. As a standalone widget it manages all required inputs and validations, and provides an address autocomplete function using Apple MapKit SDK.

The widget displays as a SwiftUI sliding bottom sheet. Once your customer has confirmed their address, the widget returns the Address object back to the application.

The Address Widget view is as follows:

```Swift
AddressSheetView(
    config: AddressWidgetConfig,
    appearance: AddressWidgetAppearance = AddressWidgetAppearance(),
    completion: @escaping (Address) -> Void)
    { ... }
``` 

An example of the widget before any customer details have been populated is as follows. The widget is in a SwiftUI View:

```Swift
import SwiftUI
import MobileSDK

struct AddressExampleView: View {
    var body: some View {
        AddressWidget(
            config: AddressWidgetConfig(),
            appearance: AddressWidgetAppearance()) { address in
                // Handle received address object
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Callback Explanation

#### Completion Callback

The `completion` callback is invoked after the address details is captured. It receives an `Address` once the address details have been saved.

### 5. Widget Styling

Defines the visual appearance and layout attributes for the `AddressWidget`. This allows for extensive customisation of how the address input fields and action button are presented to the user.

#### Appearance Contract

The `AddressWidgetAppearance` class encapsulates all configurable style properties for the widget.

```Swift
public struct AddressWidgetAppearance {
    public var horizontalSpacing: CGFloat
    public var verticalSpacing: CGFloat
    public var title: Theme.TextAppearance
    public var textField: Theme.TextFieldAppearance
    public var actionButton: Theme.ButtonAppearance
    public var expandSectionButton: Theme.ButtonAppearance
    public var searchDropdown: Theme.SearchDropdownAppearance
}
```

#### Default Appearance & Customisation

A default appearance is provided by `GlobalTheme` values for each of the subcomponents. You can use this as a starting point and customise specific attributes as needed.

##### Using Default Appearance

```Swift
    AddressWidget( 
        ...
        appearance: AddressWidgetAppearance = AddressWidgetAppearance() // Uses the default appearance
    )
```

##### Customising Appearance

You can create a custom `AddressWidgetAppearance` or modify the default one.

```Swift
struct MyCustomAddressScreen: View { 
    private func myCustomAppearance() -> AddressWidgetAppearance {
        let title = Theme.TextAppearance.init(text: .init(font: .init(name: "CustomFont", size: 20), isUnderlined: true, underlineColor: .black))
        let textField = Theme.TextFieldAppearance.init(colors: .init(active: .blue), dimensions: .init(cornerRadius: 20.0))
        let actionButton = Theme.ButtonAppearance.init(colors: .init(background: .blue))
        let appearance = AddressWidgetAppearance(
            verticalSpacing: 10,
            horizontalSpacing: 16,
            title: title,
            textField: textField,
            actionButton: actionButton)
        return appearance
    }
    
    var body: some View {
            AddressWidget( 
            ...
            appearance: AddressWidgetAppearance = myCustomAppearance()
            ...
        )
    }
}
```

*   The `TextAppearance`, `TextFieldAppearance`, `ButtonAppearance` and `SearchDropdownAppearance` themselves would have their own detailed documentation explaining their configurable attributes (like colors, typography, borders, etc.). This documentation focuses on how they are composed within the `AddressWidgetAppearance`.

### 3. Callback Explanation

#### Completion Callback

The `completion` callback is invoked after the address details is captured. It receives a `BillingAddress` once the address details have been saved.

### 4. Widget Styling

Defines the visual appearance and layout attributes for the `AddressDetailsWidget`. This class allows for extensive customisation of the address input form, including the address search functionality, manual input fields, title, and action buttons.

#### Appearance Contract

The `AddressDetailsWidgetAppearance` class encapsulates all configurable style properties for the widget.

```Kotlin
@Immutable
class AddressDetailsWidgetAppearance(
    val verticalSpacing: Dp,
    val title: TextAppearance,
    val textField: TextFieldAppearance,
    val actionButton: ButtonAppearance,
    val linkButton: LinkButtonAppearance,
    val searchDropdown: SearchDropdownAppearance
)
```

#### Default Appearance & Customisation

A default appearance is provided by `AddressDetailsAppearanceDefaults`. This uses `MaterialTheme` values and predefined component defaults for a standard look and feel. You can use this as a starting point and customise specific attributes.

##### Using Default Appearance


```Kotlin
    AddressDetailsWidget( 
        ...
        appearance = AddressDetailsAppearanceDefaults.appearance() // Uses the default appearance
    )
```

##### Customising Appearance

You can create a custom `AddressDetailsWidgetAppearance` or modify the default one using its `copy` method (if your class has one, as seen in the initially provided context).

```Kotlin
@Composable 
fun MyCustomAddressScreen() { 
    // Create appearance by using provided defaults, with custom changes
    val customAppearance = defaultFromContext.copy( // Assuming .copy() exists as per context
        verticalSpacing = 12.dp,
        title = TextAppearanceDefaults.appearance().copy(
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineSmall.copy(
                // color = MyAppColors.primary
            )
        ),
        textField = TextFieldAppearanceDefaults.outlineAppearance().copy(
            // Example: Customizing text field label color
            // labelColor = MyAppColors.onSurfaceVariant
        ),
        linkButton = LinkButtonAppearanceDefaults.appearance().copy(
            // Example: Customizing link button text style
            // textStyle = MaterialTheme.typography.labelSmall
        )
    )

    // Alternatively, create entirely from scratch:
    val completelyCustomAppearance = AddressDetailsWidgetAppearance(
        verticalSpacing = 10.dp,
        title = TextAppearanceDefaults.appearance(/*...custom title params...*/),
        textField = TextFieldAppearanceDefaults.filledAppearance(/*...custom text field params...*/),
        actionButton = ButtonAppearanceDefaults.textButtonAppearance(/*...custom button params...*/),
        linkButton = LinkButtonAppearanceDefaults.appearance(/*...custom link button params...*/),
        searchDropdown = SearchDropdownAppearanceDefaults.appearance(/*...custom search params...*/)
    )

    AddressDetailsWidget(
        ...
        appearance = customAppearance, // Use your custom appearance
    )
}
```
